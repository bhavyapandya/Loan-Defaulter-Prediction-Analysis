# Loan-Defaulter-Prediction-Analysis


## Overview
The AI-driven Loan Default Prediction project aims to enhance lending decisions and minimize financial risks by predicting whether a customer will repay the loan or fail to do so. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze various features related to loan applications and provide accurate predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains loan application information, including loan amount, term, property value, income, credit score, and several other relevant factors. The dataset has been preprocessed and transformed to ensure data quality and improve model performance.

## Project Structure
The project repository consists of the following files and directories:

- `Datasets.zip`: Compressed file containing the loan dataset.
- `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview and instructions for the project.
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the loan dataset.
- `feature_transformation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating feature transformation techniques applied to the dataset.
- `model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook showcasing the training and evaluation of machine learning models for loan default prediction.

## Usage
To run the project and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-default-prediction.git
```
2.Extract the Datasets.zip file.

3.Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks in the following order:

`analysis.ipynb`: Explore the loan dataset and gain insights through EDA.

`feature_transformation.ipynb`: Apply feature transformation techniques to normalize and improve the distribution of the selected features.

`model.ipynb`: Train and evaluate various machine learning models for loan default prediction, and select the best-performing model.

Follow the instructions provided within each notebook to execute the code and analyze the results.

## Results

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 91% on the development set. This model can be used in the banking industry to assess the risk of loan default and make informed lending decisions.
